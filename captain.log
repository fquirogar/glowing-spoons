Inspired by http://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm, 
I have decided to let this game's code be as simple as posible. 
I have faith in my capacity to do this, and I'll start in a 
mainly imperative approach.
Forgive the shit English.

5:58am Just decided to go for the convoluted OOP approach from the 
beggining, only because I felt like it. It is 5 A.M and feel 
like shit. I woke up very thirsty, and for the first time
dreamt about having a beer. Fuck.

6:26am Fuck it, back to the original plan. Let the previous 
attempt just be an inheritance review.

8:00pm I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. I fell asleep after 
the last entry and dreamt a LOT about being high. It was weird.
On the code side, I'll do it imperitably like the tanks game module
from Programaci√≥n 1's homework.
