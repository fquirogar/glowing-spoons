Inspired by http://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm, 
I have decided to let this game's code be as simple as posible. 
I have faith in my capacity to do this, and I'll start in a 
mainly imperative approach.
Forgive the shit English.

5:58am Just decided to go for the convoluted OOP approach from the 
beggining, only because I felt like it. It is 5 A.M and feel 
like shit. I woke up very thirsty, and for the first time
dreamt about having a beer. Fuck.

6:26am Fuck it, back to the original plan. Let the previous 
attempt just be a inheritance review.
